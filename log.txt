Remove flake8 ini config 

 I had changed the config to include an ignore section, but I actually 
 needed it to stay the same and instead change the order of the tox.ini 
 configuration so it would know to ignore what I wanted before it ran the 
 command: `tox`. 

- reverted back the flake8.ini to its default state 
 - changed the values of the tox.ini 
 - modified main.py to reflect those changes 
 - realized just now I had messed up my new lines 

thank you!
